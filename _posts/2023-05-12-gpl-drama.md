Last year, I was involved in, or more accurately, inadvertently instigated a row over how civ-plugins are licenced. This gets brought up every now and then, and I inadequately try to explain it, etc, you know how internet discussions go. I figured I’d write this to tell my side of the story. Before I start, I am not a lawyer, nothing you read here should be construed as legal advice, do NOT make decisions because of what you read on some guy’s blog, you should always seek the advice of a lawyer before making those decisions. I say this not only as a disclaimer, but also convey that, probably like most people, I am not educated or experienced in copyright law.

For the longest time, I had very little knowledge of copyright. I knew that pirating a movie was equivalent to stealing a car, handbag, or television, but I wouldn’t have been able to tell you what a copyright licence was, except to point at product keys. You may remember that, back in 2014, [Bukkit was DMCA’d](https://web.archive.org/web/20150207060907/http://dl.bukkit.org:80/dmca/notification.txt). I didn’t exactly know what that meant except that trying to make a modded Minecraft server became more difficult for a while. I had no idea what GPL was. I remember watching Youtube videos [like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2YbcCdxkTo) which framed the issue as a protest against working under false pretences. I didn't consider it any further than that.

Skip forward to 2018 where I had played around with a few copyright licences, mostly [ISC](https://opensource.org/license/isc-license-txt/) since I was mostly making stuff in NodeJS and seemingly _everything_ on NPM is [ISC](https://opensource.org/license/isc-license-txt/) licenced, and I am a sheep. I tried [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/) once or twice, but stopped when I heard that public domain is tricky and that many countries do not allow you to waive your copyright entirely. I was content to stick with [ISC](https://opensource.org/license/isc-license-txt/) and [MIT](https://opensource.org/license/MIT/) since their legalese is minimal, mostly readable, and seemed reasonable. At this point, while I knew that GPL was a thing in the sense that I’d seen projects labelled as GPL licenced on Github, but I couldn’t have told you what that meant.

That was also the year I received one too many #CodeItYourself’s and started contributing to Civclassic by improving the successful-purchase redstone trigger ([PR](https://github.com/CivClassic/ItemExchange/pull/1)), thinking that I was contributing under its [BSD-3](https://opensource.org/license/bsd-3-clause/) licence. I continued to contribute to Civ for 4 years under that assumption.

Then, in 2022, I happened across a conversation in a civ-development Discord server in which someone mentioned that the civ-plugins should technically be licenced under GPL because of Bukkit. Instinctively, I fought back against this… why would that be the case? A licence couldn’t require something like that, surely. And if it did, our plugins would be licenced that way. Many of our older civ-developers were professionals, they’d remind us of such, they wouldn’t do this wrong. It simply couldn’t be the case.

After a few days though, it had sunk in. They were right, Bukkit is GPL licenced, and the licence and its [FAQs](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html) say in no uncertain terms that any software which uses Bukkit code must inherit the GPL licence. But it was only when I found out that the older civ-developers already knew this that I closed my pending PRs ([eg](https://github.com/CivMC/SimpleAdminHacks/pull/31)). I had this realisation wash over me that I had just spent the past 4 years contributing under false pretences. I knew that it was unlikely in the extreme that we’d get in trouble for these mis-licences, the premium and closed source anti-cheat plugin that civ-servers had been using for years hasn’t had any issues. But the principle of it, that professional programmers would knowingly and willingly put amateur programmers like myself in that position, felt like a betrayal of trust. And what did it mean in terms of the plugins and my own contributions?

One day, I figured the only way to prevent further misleading of new developers was to correct the licence. And since [BSD-3](https://opensource.org/license/bsd-3-clause/) and [MIT](https://opensource.org/license/MIT/) are permissive licences that permit sublicencing, it should be fine. I had seen this in practice too with PolyMC relicencing into GPL ([reference](https://polymc.org/news/moving-on/)). So, I took the evening to investigate each plugin and open a PR to correct its licence. In hindsight, I should’ve opened a single PR for CivModCore and seen how that went. I did soon realise that receiving 20 odd notifications for near identical PRs for the entire civ-suite was, perhaps, a little annoying, but I tried to keep things as professional as possible. The others were… less keen to do so. Indeed, one of those older civ-developers demanded that his code be entirely excised should the plugins be relicenced ([reference](https://github.com/CivMC/FactoryMod/pull/27#issuecomment-1228870335)), echoing the Bukkit DMCA from a decade prior. This amongst the personal attacks I received which had me leaving that Discord for my own mental health, I swore off contributing to civ-plugins until they were correctly licenced.

For a while, I swore off GPL entirely too: the confusion and malcontent caused by its desire to spread like Herpes, I wanted no part in it. It meant no longer contributing to other projects, like [MapSync](https://github.com/CivPlatform/map-sync). I principally felt that GPL didn't adhere to the principle of freedom since it collapses a developer’s choice to relicence their entire codebase, no matter how big or small, or not use the library at all. In some cases, this could mean having to use other, less supported, less documented, less secure libraries. I still feel that way, though I have softened on standalone GPL software.

Looking back, it’s strange to me that going from one open source licence to another caused so much trouble and bullying. And the people who dredge this drama up aren’t usually doing so for wholesome reasons either. And while I cringe at my staggering ignorance of copyleft licences, I am proud of myself for standing up for what I believe in, even if that means receiving abuse from people I once thought of as colleagues and friends.
