**PolyMC has been compromised!**

Please backup your instances and uninstall PolyMC. If you are set on keeping PolyMC then it's recommended to change your metadata server (Settings â†’ APIs â†’ Services â†’ Metadata Server) to `https://meta.scrumplex.rocks/v1/` and your user agent (Settings â†’ APIs â†’ Miscellaneous â†’ User Agent) to something innocuous like `Foobar`.

The developers are currently using PlaceholderMC ([Github](https://github.com/PlaceholderMC), [Discord](https://discord.gg/placeholdermc)) as their "raft". They haven't yet announced whether they'll seek to reclaim PolyMC, or in successful will return to developing it. It seems, at least for the time being, that the developers are content with developing this new fork.

Here's the tea.

At 7:55pm, LennyMcLennington deleted the Code of Conduct from the PolyMC repository, labeling this "reclaim polymc from the leftoids". ([Reference](https://github.com/PolyMC/PolyMC/commit/ccf282593dcdbe189c99b81b8bc90cb203aed3ee))

At 8:18pm, LennyMcLennington stated in the PolyMC discord: *"[PolyMC] was politicised by leftists as soon as the contributor covenant got added and they started adding pride flag emojis on the discord server"* ([Reference](https://discord.com/channels/923671181020766230/923671181020766233/1031647468930215946))

At 8:25pm, Scumplex seemingly created a new Discord server named "PlaceholderMC" stating that they didn't know what was going on over at PolyMC; that all maintainers were banned by Lenny; and that this Discord was their raft now. ([Reference](https://discord.com/channels/1031648380885147709/1031649048890978324/1031649115685265460))

At 8:27pm, dada513 stated that LennyMcLennington, a founder and maintainer of PolyMC, had gone rogue; that they didn't know whether Lenny's account had been compromised or not; that Lenny had removed all permissions and membership from the Github organisation. ([Reference](https://discord.com/channels/1031648380885147709/1031649048890978324/1031649789697335328))

At 8:28pm, LennyMcLennington said in the PolyMC discord: *"They say it's compromised but all they mean is that i removed all of the contributors' permissons who were promoting radicalist leftist queer ideology, and people really think that I got hacked just because I was never public about hating this shit."* ([Reference](https://discord.com/channels/923671181020766230/923671181020766233/1031649880038457424))

At 8:36pm, Modrinth tweeted:
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Unfortunate but urgent announcement to make.<br><br>If you use PolyMC as your launcher, we are urging all users to switch off of it immediately. Not tomorrow, today.

At 9:26pm, Scrumplex announced in the PlaceholderMC discord that any previous donators to PolyMC should attempt to chargeback their donations. ([Reference](https://discord.com/channels/1031648380885147709/1031649048890978324/1031664566058360884))

At 9:44pm, BowDown097 said in the PolyMC discord: *"there is also no malware, nor will it ever be added into the project. whoever is spreading that is probably a coping power mod. this was simply an effort to purge the project of radical leftists and do a little trolling. we are in vc laughing our asses off. there is still an interest in continuing the project in some form. use whatever you want to use though ðŸ¤·"* ([Reference](https://discord.com/channels/923671181020766230/923672379144671263/1031668989941796874))

At 10:01pm, adeadhead linked to Modrinth's tweet in the Icenia discord. ([Reference](https://discord.com/channels/558071874161082368/957804789029294092/1031673358640758815)) This lead me to joining the PolyMC discord for more information and seeing a packed event-voice chat. After joining, they, the people with unmute permissions, were imitating Zelenskyy's accent and being openly transphobic.

At 10:11pm, Scrumplex posted in the PlaceholderMC discord an answer to an FAQ stating that some packages are still under their control, such as the Flatpak, but also notes that LennyMcLennington was banned from AUR. ([Reference](https://discord.com/channels/1031648380885147709/1031655392821919907/1031675731572437052))

At 11:24pm, LennyMcLennington made an announcement in the PolyMC discord claiming that he uses two-factor authentication for Discord and Github, and linking to a public-paste of a PGP signed message. ([Reference](https://discord.com/channels/923671181020766230/923672379144671263/1031694145833680906))

At 00:14am, Zeke announced in the PlaceholderMC discord that they've reached 2000 members. ([Reference](https://discord.com/channels/1031648380885147709/1031649048890978324/1031706756751036518))

It's unclear what specifically triggered LennyMcLennington. Though his propensities were hinted at in various places, like naming a commit "penis", recommending a troll theme for PolyMC, and his email being `lenny@sneed.church`, this was nonetheless rather drastic and will inevitably haunt his reputation. Similarly, the offhanded way they say *"there is still an interest in continuing the project in some form"* suggests a bleak future for PolyMC too.

It's still possible, perhaps, that LennyMcLennington's account was hacked, but it's more likely that this was a coup. For this reason I have to agree with the sentiments of the PlaceholderMC developers that PolyMC is no longer safe to install and use: you don't want to have auto-updating software on your computer made by someone who'll coup their development team over pride flag emojis on the project's Discord server.

In the meantime while PlaceholderMC establishes its infrastructure, here are some alternative launchers you can use: [MultiMC](https://multimc.org/), [GDLauncher](https://gdevs.io/), [ATLauncher](https://atlauncher.com/).
